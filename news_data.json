          "description": "《智能涌现》获悉，飞书将与安克创新联合发布一款名为“AI录音豆”的智能录音硬件。\n  从我们获得的资料来看，这是一款重量仅10克的圆形设备，外观呈豆状，机身搭载双MEMS麦克风阵列，整机配合充电舱重量约48克。产品支持蓝牙与Wi-Fi两种传输模式，主打无感佩戴和随时录音。\n  自2025年海外创业公司Plaud凭借AI录音卡片产品打开市场后，国内已有多家厂商跟进推出类似产品，但大厂亲自下场做AI录音硬件的案例并不多见。\n  从2017年成立以来，飞书从未推出过硬件产品。多位接近飞书的人士向36氪表示，这款AI录音豆在飞书内部属于探索性项目，飞书产品团队负责软件部分研发工作。\n  从2024年开始，市面上也出现不少AI硬件的创新形态——录音卡片、录音豆、AI便携相机、AI眼镜等产品相继涌现。这些产品都试图在手机之外，找到一个更贴近用户日常场景的AI交互入口。\n  飞书和安克创新并没有跟随市场主流的卡片形态，而是选择了更小巧的“豆”状设计，这是一个有意的差异化选择。\n  卡片形态的优势在于，可以贴合手机背面、利用磁吸，但代价是体积更大、佩戴场景比较受限；豆状设计更像近年流行的AI陪伴硬件，",
